Things to talk about with Irvin:

    Email servers, need smtp to send email. Idk if they already have one or if they need one. Can use google
    Show that location managers need to be assigned to location to manage them


    Log hours process:
        Student request to log hours -> Sends email with unique url to location manager -> location manager goes to confirm site which confirms token and user -> sends email to staff member for record then adds hours to student profile

    Location sign up Process:
        Site fills out location sign up form -> request sent to staff who adds to database and assigns manager to location

    Companies adding opportunities:
        Need to add a box for them to add a description
        Need to add a button for them to add an image
